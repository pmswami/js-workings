// OOP is programming paradigm to write and oranize code
// all related data and method are into one class
// Objects contains data and methods
// Objects are created from classes
// Classes are blueprints for creating objects
// Classes are used to define properties and methods
// Classes are used to create objects
// Classes are used to define the structure of objects
// Classes are used to define the behavior of objects
// OOP is used to remove spaghetti code
// OOP is used to make code more modular
// OOP is used to make code more reusable
// OOP is used to make code more maintainable
// OOP is used to make code more readable
// OOP is used to make code more efficient
// OOP is used to make code more scalable
// OOP is used to make code more secure

// Fundamental Principles of OOP
// 1. Abstraction -> Hiding the details which dont matter to the user
// 2. Encapsulation -> Keeping some properties private inside the class, which cant be accessed from outside of the class
// 3. Inheritance -> One class can inherit the properties of other class.
// 4. Polymorphism -> A child can overwrite a method inherited from parent class

// All objects in JS are linked to a prototype object
// Prototypal Inheritance -> The prototype contains methods (behavior) hat are accessible to all objects linked to that prototype
// Behavior is delegated to the linked prototype object
// All objects in JS are linked to a prototype object
